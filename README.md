# Self-Driving Car Repo
This repository will store my work on self driving cars.

Currently there is one notebook, SelfDriving.ipnyb, that implements the R.A.L.P.H. (Rapidly Adapting Lateral Position Handler) algorithm developed at Carnegie Mellon in the 

## Areas of Improvement
  * Correct for image distortion from the camera
  * Find relation between realworld distance and image distance to get accurate measurements of curvature
  * Pad the array with 0's when shifting pixels around to determine the curvature of the road
